- Well after all the backstory, inspecting the index.html page gives Ist part of the flag.
   - "Robot writing scripts" takes us to either the index.js file or the robots.txt file.
   - After some research and failures, you'd realise that index.js would just give wrong flag.

- Go to /robots.txt, it gives the IInd part of the flag.
  - "Made this website good looking", obviously we should go to styles.css now.

- Reading a comment in styles gives us the IIIrd part of the flag.

- Now we have no more hints and a lot of commented stuff in the css file. Well, read it.
  - "I love using the same text styles" and  ```text-transform: togglecase; ``` is written again and again.
  - We got to the hint. Maybe togglecase will give the format of the IVth part of the flag?

- Read the comments again. Some image is hidden below. Who is he? Google Image search ftw. The guy is Lester.
- togglecase and Lester make us think about IVth part of the flag. lEsTeR or LeStEr.
